            <h2>Character Name</h2>
            <li> An exciting and indepth character starts with a good name, the character creation book provides suggestions on naming your character based off of race and other key features, however the name you choose should help you personify your hero as you envision them. Every good story begins with a name.</li>
            <h2>Classification</h2>
            <li> This area is used to keep track of some important key characteristics of your characters personality and values. The most important being the characters chosen class, whether it be a spell caster, fighter, archer. The current level the players character has attained. A given alignment directs the characters motivations and actions, from wreckless and unforgiving to kind and lawful. Lastly a short description including race and sex. </li>
            <h2>Character Stats</h2>
            <li> You characters ability to out-fight, out-talk, or out-whit other players or characters you encounter on your journey is dependent on the stats of your hero. Stats are chosen while making the character sheet by a random roll of dice. Dont sweat if you score low in a particular category, as your hero goes on adventures it will learn and progress getting better after every encounter.</li>
            <h2>Background Features</h2>
            <li> Choosing the life experiences and background of your character will play a massive part in how you choose to role-play the encounters your hero faces. Traits, abilities, languages, abilities, and other background of your hero shapes who they are at the start of your adventure. A childhood trauma, or a quest to prove ones worth etc... determin how your chacter views the world and moves forward in its journey. The new experiences you encounter will continue to mold and shape the hero, or villian, your become. </li>
            <h2>Fortification</h2>
            <li> The adventures your take your hero on will often lead to some tight spots, dangerous feats, and to the thrill of battle. Your heros hitpoints determines how much of a beating you can take before being knocked uncounsious. Based on your heros constitution, armor, if they have a shield, and other factors an AC (armor class) will be calculated this value determines how hard is it to land a blow on your hero. Being more hearty obviously has trade offs, if you want to be a protective paladin then a high AC is perfect. However, if you want to be a sneaky rouge making calculated moves and strikes a lower AC provides more mobility to accomplish that. </li>
            <h2>Skills</h2>
            <li> Based on the players level a certain ammount of knowledge can be invested in gaining skills. These span everything from stretching your mind and will to preforming impressing physical feats of acrobatics. Choosing your skills should help shape your character and reinforce your vision for what you want your hero to accomplish, but also should help your team in completing your quests and having fun while adventuring.</li>
            <h2>Inventory</h2>
            <li> You inventory is a convienint place to keep track of the wealth you are rewarded when helping in-game characters, or in some cases stealing from them instead. This area helps you keep straight what tools you have in your arsenal to accomplish your goals, slay your enemies, and master your class. A heavy mace may come in handy for your knight friend and some explosive arrows might be of use to the party's ranger. Whatever you find on your adventures, there is always a practicle use as well as something humorous to be done.</li>
